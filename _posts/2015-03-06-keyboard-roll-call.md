Here's a list of all my current keyboards:

**Dell Model M**
> The impetus of my keyboard collecting.
> I found it in the basement of my dorm when I was an RA, doing laundry one night.
> This was right at the beginning of the mechanical keyboard craze, so I was really wanting one for myself but I wasn't willing to shell out >$50 for one
> When I first picked it up there was a thick layer of dust on it, it must have not been touched in 10 years.
> Even though no one was going to miss it, I still felt guilty just swiping it.
> I wasn't going to let a perfectly good keyboard go though, so I stashed it in my laundry basket and snuck it upstairs.
> It was my daily driver for about 4 years until I got my current keyboard.

**Two other Model M's**
> Found these at my school's surplus sale for $5, too good to pass up.
> Unfortunately, they both have AT connectors, but I have only one AT-to-PS/2 adaptor.
> I tossed one of them carelessly one time and smashed the F10 key, so the collectors value is basically ruined.
> Either way, it's worth having them around as arm weights, these things are built solid.

**CODE Tenkeyless - Cherry MX Clear**
> My work keyboard.
> With the clear switch I can have the mechanical experience with tactile feedback and less noise than blue/green switches.
> The media controls are all on the right which allows for nice one-handed operation.
> Overall, I picked this one for the aesthetics.
> The caps and scroll lock indicators aren't obnoxious, the case has a nice matte finish, and the Helvetica keycaps are nice and clean looking
> I may get O-ring dampeners for this one in the future to eliminate noise even further, I'm still not at touch-typing levels.

**Rosewill RGB80 Kailh Blue**
> My current daily driver.
> I had gone a while without a keyboard purchase, and this one popped up on sale at Newegg
> I usually buy keyboards that have features that I don't already have, so I felt justified with this one.
> The Kailh switches get a bad rap for being in keyboards with lower quality control, but I think they work just fine.
> I may have had a few failed actuations, but it may just be my imagination, I'll have to use it more to see.
> My previous keyboards had heavier switches:
> Cherry MX Clears take 55 cN to actuate, buckling springs take 65-70 cN.
> These blue switches take about 50 cN to actuate, I can definitely tell the difference after typing on Clears all day.
> The RGB80 also has multicolored backlighting, but the software to set the colors seems slow and not quite user friendly.
> It claims to be able to set 16.8 million colors, but I'm pretty sure it's just 228 but with a fancy color picker.
> You have to click directly on a color picker to set the color, there's no way to input the rgb values yourself.
> I'll give it a pass for being an alright keyboard, but promises like that should be delivered on.

**AEG Olympia Cherry MY**
> Found at a Salvation Army for $1.
> I had no idea about the MY switch when I picked it up, I just felt a linear action switch and the plus shaped stem and I was sold.
> It's definitely the most unique of all my mechanicals, sporting the awful switch, 3-toned vintage color scheme, and interesting keycap profile.
> Instead of the usual nib on the "F" and "J" keys, the keys have higher edges and dip slightly lower than the other keys.
> 
> Typing on it is a nightmare with an actuation force of 30 cN.
> Even leaving my fingers resting on a key would trigger the switch. 
> I would look away from what I was typing and look back to "ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff" more than once.
> Elsewhere on the internet, Cherry MYs have been described as "typing on wet newspaper" and "prodding a dead octopus", and I agree 100 percent
> The Esc and arrow keys are currently on my CODE Tenkeyless, just a little personalization.

**Packard Bell whatever rubber dome**
> Another Salvation Army find, another learning experience.
> I typed on it and felt rubber dome, but when I pulled the keycap off, I saw the Cherry stem.
> My assumption was that only mechanical switches had that stem, but it turns out some rubber domes just had that going for them back in the day.
> The price tag was only $1.50, so it wasn't too much of a bank buster, another good learning experience.
> It was built well for a rubber dome, sporting an aluminum back and silicon pcb instead of the plastic sheet in current rubber domes.

**Saitek Eclipse II rubber dome**
> Given to me by my roommate during my freshman year.
> I played a lot of TF2 back in that year, and my stock Dell keyboard had a space bar that was just too loud.
> He had this one just laying around extra, I think he won it somewhere?
> I was stoked just because it had LED backlighting (blue, red, and both at once for purple!).
> I used this for a year-and-a-half-ish until I stumbled upon the Model M (above).

**Rosewill Chicklet rubber dome**
> I wanted a chicklet keyboard, this one was like $10.  Whatever.
> It's my go-to for "I need to plug in a keyboard into this thing" since I don't feel like moving my primary keyboards from their usual spots.

**Lenovo stock keyboard**
> Awful, awful keyboard, but I got it for free from an old build.
> Just another rubber dome chicklet, but these keys are spaced way too far apart to be comfortable.
> Additionally, the lower left-most key is the FN key instead of Ctrl, so all muscle memory goes right out the window.

And last but not least:
**Brainworks Star Trek TNG Child's keyboard**
> This one came in it's original packaging, a box with a smiling boy in full Redshirt regalia flying through space alongside the giant message of "IT'S A KEYBOARD!", as if that wasn't obvious.
> Sporting a Starfleet insignia on the wristrest, rubber grips on either side, giant easy-to-read buttons and a space bar that reads "Space, The Final Frontier", this keyboard is a real treasure.
> It's tenkeyless, but the format is <80%, almost like a 60% with the arrow keys and Delete/Insert/etc squished into the right side
> I just wish it was easier to type on: pulling off the keycap reveals some sort of plastic stabilizer under each key, forcing the poor child using it to strike dead center to get the switch to actuate.
> Also, the back has instructions for starting a light show, but it only cycles through lighting up the caps/num/scroll lock LEDs one at a time. Disappointing.

Maybe someday I'll justify an ErgoDox, but for now, this is what I have.
